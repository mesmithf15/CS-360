Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The application I developed was the inventory app, which required the app to be able to allow user to take items and add them to a inventory list, while also allowing for users to add in count of quantity or decrease in count, while also allowing user to delete items if they wish. This application was designed to help users manage their item count, allowing for a quick and easy way to keep track.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens and features that were needed for users to use this app were the login screen, which allowed users to protect their list while also being able to access their list without worry of there data being tampered with by another source/person. With this screen a create login page was then needed to allow new users the ability to create an account to start using the features of the app. It then needed a list page, that shows all the users items in a list, while having features that allow adding, deleteing, increasing, and decreasing counts of items and their quantity. My UI design tries to keep the user in mind by making a simply screen that had button features that easily allow for the wanted function.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

When it came to my approach on coding my app, I made sure to iterate through the code, testing to see the results and recoding any needed changes to reach the desired goal. By also using techniques as in naming sense, as well as, using proper coding techniques like in line comments, I can allow for the code to be reviewed by others, while also keeping it clean. This approach can be applied to many future applications and projects. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

By using the emulator in the android studio, I was able to see the screens layout and design using the split and design view to see how the code produced the screen, and then running it on an emulator allows for testing the code as if I had it on a moblie device. This process helps to give me a visual look at the screens and how the code worked with the layout, allowing me to make changes before running it on the emulator, in which then I would be able to test the functionality of the code.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

When it comes to the whole process, the place I had to innovate to overcome a challenge was the page layouts during the coding, and the use of SMS. While reading and researching on the topic of SMS, I was able to get a better understanding to then apply it to my code.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believed the component that I was particularly successful in demostrating my knowledge and skills was in the use of the layout files, and how the varying layouts, TextViews, and buttons were used and the code used to apply different changes to the screens of the application.
